1.	First, turn on the DE2 board/robot. All of the bottom row of LEDs, both red and green, should be turned on. Likewise, the 7-segment display should be printing "FFFF FFFF", while the LCD prints "FFFF". If any of these outputs are not working, it is likely a hardware issues. They will be essential to the subsequent tests.

2.	Now that the outputs are shown to work, flip all of the bottom row of switches into the "down" position, then press KEY[0]. All of the LEDs should turn off, and the displays should be printing "0000 0000" and "0001", respectively.

3.	One by one, flip the switches into the "up" position (disregard SW_17). For each switch flipped, the corresponding LED above it should turn on. Once all of the LEDs are turned on, press KEY[3], then KEY[2], then KEY[1], in any order. Do not press KEY[0], as it is assigned as a RESET to the this test.

4.	The LCD should change to print "0010" after these steps, demonstrating all the inputs we will use are working. Return all of the switches to "down" position.

5.	Now press KEY[1]. A single LED should turn on, shifting from right to left along all the red LEDs. It should move at a rate of approximately 1 LED shift per second. The LCD should read "0011".

6.	Press KEY[1] again. The speed should double, demonstrating the correct operation of the DE2 board's Timer. 

7.	Press KEY[1]. A beep should sound, lasting about 3 seconds. If this works, then the beep module is shown to work. LCD should read "0012".

8.	Now press KEY[1]. The battery voltage should be printed on the 7-segment display. If it acceptable, press KEY[1] again. If the voltage is dangerously low, the machine will beep and refuse to proceed.
